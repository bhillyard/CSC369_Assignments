1. How do balance updates in Clash Royale influence the competitive meta?

2. As a clash royale player myself, I have experienced cards feeling worse after they get nerfed or too strong when they get buffed, but I want to quantify that using the clash royale dataset found on Kaggle.

3. After a balance update, cards that receive buffs will see a significant increase in usage and win rates, while nerfed cards will experience a decline. I would say that it makes sense that cards becoming worse will see a decline in play, but it would be interesting to look at different metrics of card usage and winrate compared between before and after balance changes in the dataset. I also think it could be useful to make a post in clash royale forums of my findings to show interesting metrics to the players as well.

4. The dataset is this clash royale dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/s1m0n38/clash-royale-games/data)
